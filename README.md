# 🇮🇳 Pandas for Data Analysis — My Learning Journey (Zero to Advanced)

Namaste 🙏 and welcome to my repository!  
This is where I’ve documented my complete journey of learning **Pandas**, from absolute beginner to handling advanced data analysis tasks confidently.

If you’re someone who’s just starting out or looking to brush up your Pandas skills with practical, hands-on examples — you’ll feel right at home here 😊

## 📘 About This Repo

This repo is like my digital notebook 📒, where I’ve explored different features and capabilities of Pandas — one of the most powerful Python libraries for data analysis.

I’ve tried to keep everything simple, step-by-step, and beginner-friendly. As I learnt new concepts, I documented them in Jupyter notebooks so that others (like you!) can follow along too.
